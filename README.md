# Forecast Verification Platform

A Python-based data engineering and analytics project that retrieves archived weather forecast data and historical atmospheric observations through external APIs, stores normalized records in a relational database, and evaluates forecast performance using standard forecast verification metrics.

This project was designed to simulate a simplified forecast verification workflow used in atmospheric science and operational forecasting while demonstrating practical software engineering, API integration, SQL database design, data processing, and statistical analysis skills.

---

## Project Overview

Numerical weather prediction models generate forecasts continuously, but evaluating forecast performance requires comparing forecast output against observed atmospheric conditions after the valid time has passed.

This project automates that workflow by retrieving archived forecast data and corresponding historical weather observations, storing the data in a structured relational database, calculating forecast error statistics, and generating analytical visualizations to assess forecast performance.

The overall objective was to build a realistic end-to-end data pipeline that combines software engineering practices with domain-specific scientific analysis.

## Verification Methodology

The verification workflow performs time-matched comparisons between archived forecast values and corresponding historical atmospheric conditions.

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Retrieve archived hourly forecast temperatures from Open-Meteo Historical Forecast API
2. Retrieve historical hourly weather data from Open-Meteo Historical Weather Archive API
3. Store normalized forecast and observation reports in SQLite database
4. Match forecast and observed values by location and valid timestamp
5. Calculate forecast error for each matched pair
6. Compute aggregate forecast verification metrics
7. Generate visualizations for analysis

---

## Forecast Verification Metrics

The project calculates standard forecast verification metrics commonly used in meteorology and atmospheric science.

### Bias

Measures average forecast overprediction or underprediction.

```text
Bias = Mean(Forecast - Observed)
```

Positive bias indicates systematic overforecasting.

Negative bias indicates systematic underforecasting.

### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Measures average forecast error magnitude.

```text
MAE = Mean(|Forecast - Observed|)
```

Lower MAE indicates better forecast performance.

### Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

Measures forecast error while penalizing larger forecast misses.

```text
RMSE = sqrt(Mean((Forecast - Observed)^2))
```

Lower RMSE indicates better forecast performance.

The pipeline automatically performs the following workflow:

1. Initialize SQLite database and create schema
2. Retrieve archived forecast data from Open-Meteo Historical Forecast API
3. Retrieve historical weather observations from Open-Meteo Historical Weather API
4. Store normalized forecast and observation records in the database
5. Match forecast and observed values by valid timestamp
6. Calculate forecast verification metrics (Bias, MAE, RMSE)
7. Save verification results to the database
8. Generate visualization outputs for analysis

To process a single configured location:

```bash
python -m src.run_pipeline --location central_kansas_test
```
